Exercise 22.8
Read and Write to a Binary file prime numbers within a set range

Program is set to first create a binary file to be saved in the project folder.
During this process a four loop is entered iterating through a set range of numbers 1-100.
Logic s implemented in order to check to see if each number is prime.
If the number is prime it will be written to the binary file.
After the above iteration is finished reading of the binary file is implemented
The file is then iterated through printing each number to the console



## Analysis Steps

This section should restate the assignment and explain how you analyzed the requirements in order 
to develop a solution.

First logic was needed t be written in order to check for prime numbers
Second we were shown we need to implement IOExceptions while reading or writing a file
Conditional try blocks were used to house the file handling logic properly
